# conferences
We are trying to maintain a collection of presentation slides/materials released on various R conferences. The goal is to automatically generate a rmarkdown site listing and centralizing all these resources in a reader-friendly way. We don't have this yet but it's coming! ;)

# To contribute
- If you are at a R conference (or even a meet-up) and the speakers have provided links to their slides/github repo, please feel free to fire a PR and list them here in the format provided
- `conference.csv` lists some meta data for those conferences. If the conference you just joined is not there, please edit that file. 
- (Once we finished the markdown generating process) You only need to update the csvs and the markdown document will (hopefully) do its job.
- If possible, I will try to put the original address instead of shortened links like bit.ly in the link column.
