# ðŸŽ‰ RWeekly Conferences ðŸŽ‰
Twitter is a great place to _share_ conference slides but... it doesn't seem to be the best place to _read_ all these shared information. No need to mention a few days after the conference, all those shared links are just gone from your timeline. 

Here we are trying to create a repo to collect shared conference slides or github repos. As a result, you, me and everyone can enjoy our awesome #rstats conferences even if (s)he cannot make the trip. 

Please help us log as many resources as possible by [submitting a PR](https://github.com/rweekly/conferences/compare). We also encourage conference presenters to post links to their slides directly here after their presentation. 

# To Contribute
1. All the conference posts are stored in the `_conferences` folder as `yaml` headers in those `md` files. 
2. Besides slides, we also want to highlight interesting #rstats packages announced or demonstrated during the conferences. These information should go to the `packages` section. 
3. We will create an entry for big #rstats events ahead of time. 
4. If you want to add a new event that is not listed, you can copy [this file](https://github.com/rweekly/conferences/blob/master/_conferences/template.md) as a template and start from there
5. If you are a presenter but you don't want your slides to be shared here, please let us know or fix it by yourself. 
6. If you have any new ideas, let us know by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/rweekly/conferences/issues/new).
